# Workflow Summary: The Gnomo Palomo Guide 🧙‍♂️✨

This document outlines the creative process for producing AI-generated "vlogs" featuring a fantasy character (The Gnomo Palomo) traveling through diverse digital and imaginary worlds.

## 1. Scripting & Concept
The foundation of every video is a short story with a "travel vlog" tone—adventurous, humorous, and meta.
- **Tools:** ChatGPT or Claude.
- **The Workflow:** Write in the first person. The Gnomo Palomo interacts with the "camera" as if he is livestreaming or recording a story from a specific location (e.g., a black market, a pirate ship, or a pixelated forest).
- **Pro Tip:** Use colloquial language, regional slang, and pop culture references to make the character feel authentic and funny.

## 2. Voiceover (VO)
The voice is the character's soul. It needs to be high-energy and unique.
- **Tool:** **ElevenLabs**.
- **The Process:** Use voice cloning or a specific preset with adjusted stability and clarity settings to achieve a high-pitched, energetic "gnome-like" tone.
- **Detail:** Manually add laughter, sighs, or gasps into the text prompts to break the robotic feel and add "acting" to the AI voice.

## 3. Visuals & Character Consistency
Maintaining the same appearance for the Gnomo in every shot is essential for storytelling.
- **Tools:** **Midjourney** (Image generation) and **Nano Banana Pro** (Image editing).
- **Aesthetic:** Can vary between Anime, 3D, or Realistic Fantasy. Generate the character in various environments while keeping his signature traits (red hat, white beard).
- **Prompting:** Use "vlog-style" descriptors like "fisheye lens," "low angle," or "selfie perspective" to simulate someone holding a camera.

## 4. Animation (Image-to-Video)
This step converts static images into dynamic, "handheld" footage.
- **Tools:** **Luma Dream Machine**, **Runway Gen-3/Gen-2**, **Kling**, or **Seedream**.
- **The Technique:** Use nano banana and the motion prompts to simulate a vlog, use commands like `handheld camera shake`, `walking forward`, or `character looking into lens and talking`.

## 5. Editing & Post-Production
This stage adds the "UI" layer that makes it look like a real social media post.
- **Tools:** **CapCut** or **Adobe Premiere**.
- **Overlays:** Add a "REC" icon, battery bars, and fake scrolling comments (simulating TikTok or Twitch).
- **Sound Design (SFX):** Layer in footsteps, wind, magic sounds, and "meme" sound effects for comedic timing.
- **Music:** Use background music from popular video games (e.g., Zelda, MapleStory) at a low volume.

## 6. The "Palomo" Strategy
- **Consistency:** Always keep the character recognizable so the audience builds a connection.
- **Engagement:** Have the character talk directly to the "viewers," asking them to like, subscribe, or comment on where he should go next.
- **Absurdity:** Contrast high-fantasy settings with mundane "influencer" problems.

# Sebastián Lara | Software Engineer & AI Content Architect

I am a Software Engineer with 15 years of experience building software for sillicon valley startups mostly.

For the last 3 years, I have pivoted into the world of **Generative AI**, focusing on the intersection of technical automation and high-level storytelling.

## 🧠 My Philosophy: Execution != Thinking
I believe in "Vibe Coding" applied to content creation. 

I use AI to automate the repetitive tasks of production so I can spend 100% of my energy on the **thinking: POV, the hook, the unique angle, and the narrative intent**.

- **15 Years of Engineering:** Deep understanding of code, startups, and technical implementation.
- **3 Years of AI Mastery:** Expert in prompt engineering, agentic workflows, and AI cinematography.
- **Zero AI Slop:** My workflows are designed to ensure every piece of content sounds human and looks intentional.

## 🛠 Featured Projects

### 1. [Gnomo Palomo](https://www.instagram.com/gnomopalomo) (AI Storytelling)
A science fiction universe following a "blogger" dwarf.
- **Results:** Reached **500k Followers in 6 months**; even low-performing videos reach 1M+ views.
- **Role:** Full-stack production including scripting, storyboarding, visual generation, and editing.
- **Logic:** Detailed narrative architecture can be found in [The Gnomo Guide](./gnomo-palomo-guide.md).

### 2. [sebastianlara.io](https://www.instagram.com/sebastianlara.io/) (GenAI Education & Storytelling)
I use this platform to prove that in the AI era, taste is the new capital and vision is the true requirement, not the camera.

**Focus:**
* **AI Cinematography:** Applying professional film principles, such as lens selection (Warm Cinema Prime), specific focal lengths (50mm), and wide apertures (f/1.4), to AI video to achieve high-end production value.
* **Psychological Storytelling:** Leveraging neuroscience and behavioral research to create narrative frameworks that bypass logical resistance.
* **Agentic Workflow Architecture:** Designing custom pre-production systems like `[/create-short]` and `[/generate-scenes]` to automate execution while preserving 100% of the unique POV.
* **Behavioral Narrative Patterns:** Implementing patterns like "The Paradox of Choice" to move viewers from passive scrolling to active reflection.

**Current Favorite Tech Stack:**

| Category | Tools & Models |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Logic & Scripting** | **Claude Code** (Workflow automation), **Gemini 3 Flash** (Research & Strategy) |
| **Video & Motion** | **Kling 3**, **Seedance 2.0**, **Higgsfield Cinema Studio 2.0**, **SeeDream** |

## ⚙️ Custom AI Agentic Workflows
I build my own "Skills" to automate my content engine:

- **[/create-short](./create-short.md):** An interactive director that finds contrarian POVs and scroll-stopping hooks from raw "seeds".
- **[/generate-scenes](./generate-scenes.md):** A cinematography agent for Higgsfield that makes intelligent lens and lighting decisions to maximize emotional impact.

## 🚀 Personal Data
- **Location:** USA / Colombia.
- **Native Language:** English / Spanish

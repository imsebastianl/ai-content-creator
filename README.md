# Sebastián Lara | Software Engineer & AI Content Architect

I am a Software Engineer with 15 years of experience solving problems behind a screen. 

For the last 3 years, I have pivoted into the world of **Generative AI**, focusing on the intersection of technical automation and high-level storytelling.

## 🧠 My Philosophy: execution != Thinking
I believe in "Vibe Coding" applied to content creation. I use AI to automate the repetitive tasks of production so I can spend 100% of my energy on the **thinking: POV, the hook, the unique angle, outro, etc**. 

- **15 Years of Engineering:** Deep understanding of code, startups, and technical implementation.
- **3 Years of AI Mastery:** Expert in prompt engineering, agentic workflows, and AI cinematography.
- **Zero AI Slop:** My workflows are designed to ensure every piece of content sounds human and looks intentional.

## 🛠 Featured Projects

### 1. [Gnomo Palomo](https://www.instagram.com/gnomopalomo) (AI Storytelling)
A science fiction universe following a "blogger" dwarf. 

We reached 500k Followers in 6 months of building, a bad video reachs at least 1M people and people love it.

- **Role:** Scripting, storyboarding, visual generation, and editing.
- **Goal:** Creating a consistent character world using AI tools.
- **Logic:** You can read the full production details here [TODO: The Gnomo Guide](https://gnomopalomo.notion.site/LA-GU-A-DEL-GNOMO-PALOMO-25ada83520ee80dd93dce23969fabcef).

### 2. [sebastianlara.io](https://www.instagram.com/sebastianlara.io/) (GenAI Education & Storytelling)
This is my personal laboratory for transitioning from a "Creator" to a "Director." I use this platform to prove that in the AI era, taste is the new capital and vision is the true requirement, not the camera.

**Focus:**
* **AI Cinematography:** I apply professional film principles, such as lens selection (Warm Cinema Prime), specific focal lengths (50mm), and wide apertures (f/1.4), to AI video generation to eliminate "AI slop" and achieve high-end production value.
* **Psychological Storytelling:** I leverage neuroscience and behavioral research, to create narrative frameworks that bypass logical resistance and trigger deep viewer engagement.
* **Agentic Workflow Architecture:** I design custom pre-production systems, such as the `[/create-short](./create-short.md)` and `[/generate-scenes](./generate-scenes.md)` command, that automate the heavy lifting of execution while preserving 100% of the creator's intent and unique POV.
* **Behavioral Narrative Patterns:** I implement advanced storytelling patterns like "The Paradox of Choice" and "Existential Urgency" to move viewers from passive scrolling to active reflection.

## ⚙️ Custom AI Agentic Workflows
I build my own "Skills" to automate my content engine:

- **[/create-short](./create-short.md):** An interactive director that takes a "seed" (article, transcript, or idea) and helps me find a contrarian POV and a scroll-stopping hook.
- **[/generate-scenes](./generate-scenes.md):** A cinematography agent for Higgsfield Cinema Studio that makes intelligent decisions on lenses (Warm Cinema Prime), focal lengths (50mm), and apertures (f/1.4) to maximize emotional impact.

## 🚀 Personal Stats & Rigor
- **Location:** USA.
- **Native Language:** Spanish (fluent in English, practicing Italian).
